# Monte
This directory contains the monte carlo functions used for the Townsend coeffiecient calculation. 
## Monte - Time planes
These Monte Carlo functions simulate the electrons in an environment with 7 sequential time planes. It then outputs discrete value about each plane.
This Monte Carlo function is used for the Time of flight calculations.

## Monte - Space planes
These Monte Carlo functions simulate the electrons in an environment with 7 sequential space planes. It then outputs discrete values about each plane. 
This Monte Carlo function is used for the Steady state Townsend calculation.
