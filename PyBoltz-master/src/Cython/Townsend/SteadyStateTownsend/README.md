## SST - Steady state townsend.
This directory has the SST.pyx. This file takes the output values in the SPlanes arraies. Those values are simulated by the Monte/MONTEFDT.pyx file. From the time, energy, velocity and count of the electrons at each of the 7 space planes it outputs values such as the Towensend coeffiecients, velocity, and diffusion.
